# Mancala-Game-Program
This program simulates Mancala. The game Mancala is one of the  oldest games in recorded history.  You can read more about it here: https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-play-mancala-409424
In this board game, a Mancala board is made of two rows of 6 cups, with two bigger cups at the ends. Each cup holds some number of stones or chips. 
In this program a Mancala board is represented as a 2-dimensional list of integers. Each item in the lists represents a cup, and the number  represents how many 
stones are currently in that cup.

With this board representation, the game is over when every cup is empty except the top left and the bottom right. When the game is over, whoever 
has more stones in their cup wins: if the top left has more stones, the top player wins. If the bottom right has more stones, the bottom player wins.
